Welcome to the SmartBin repository, where we aim to drive sustainable recycling behaviors using an interactive, IoT-based smart trash bin. This project leverages persuasive technology and participatory design methodologies to increase user engagement in recycling, with applications that are particularly impactful in educational and community settings.

Project Overview
The SmartBin project integrates concepts from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Internet of Things (IoT), and behavioral psychology to promote environmentally conscious actions. Through smart technology and engaging feedback mechanisms, the SmartBin system encourages users to make sustainable choices by providing real-time feedback and educational content on recycling.

Key Features
Interactive Feedback: Equipped with sensors to detect waste disposal, the bin provides instant feedback using memes and animations, making the recycling experience engaging and rewarding.
Real-Time Monitoring: The SmartBin uses ultrasonic and laser sensors to monitor its fill level, notifying waste collectors when it is ready for emptying, thus optimizing collection schedules.
Educational Content: Through a web application, the SmartBin system offers information on recycling practices, locations for material disposal, and the environmental impact of proper waste management.
Installation and Setup
Hardware Requirements:

Raspberry Pi (Model 3 B+ or higher)
Ultrasonic sensor for bin level detection
Laser and LDR sensor for disposal detection
Monitor for meme display
WiFi connectivity for IoT functionalities
Software Requirements:

Python 3.x
Required libraries listed in requirements.txt
Telegram bot setup for real-time notifications to waste collection teams
Setup:

Clone the repository and install the required libraries.
Configure the sensors and the Telegram bot for notifications.
Deploy the application on the Raspberry Pi and ensure all connections are secure.
Usage
Disposal Detection: As users dispose of items, the system detects the action and displays an educational or motivational meme to reinforce recycling behavior.
Monitoring and Notifications: When the bin reaches capacity, the system notifies the waste collection team via Telegram for timely emptying.
Web Application: Accessible from any device, the web app provides recycling tips, locations of collection centers, and interactive content on sustainability.
Design and Methodology
SmartBin was developed using a Participatory Action Design Research approach, involving students and community members in design cycles to iteratively improve user engagement. Insights from these cycles have shaped the user-centric design and features, prioritizing accessibility and effectiveness in promoting recycling behaviors.

Main Design Cycles
Cycle 1: Web application for recycling education, focusing on the younger demographic with interactive, meme-based content.
Cycle 2: Development of the Smart Trash Bin prototype with IoT capabilities, real-time monitoring, and feedback mechanisms.
Contribution Guidelines
Contributions are welcome! Please see our Contributing Guide for details on the code of conduct, coding standards, and submission process.

Future Directions
Planned enhancements include:

Integrating gamification elements, such as rewards for frequent users.
Expanding compatibility with other messaging platforms beyond Telegram.
Developing an all-in-one platform integrating both the web application and SmartBin for a unified user experience.
